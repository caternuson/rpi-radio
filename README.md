rpi-radio
=========

Python code for Raspberry Pi based internet radio and music server.

This was orignally going to be a stand alone music player with its own amp and speaker. However, found it easier to just attach it to existing stereo and run it headless using mpd. Added a 8x8 bicolor and alpha numeric matrix to give it some fun display capabilities.
